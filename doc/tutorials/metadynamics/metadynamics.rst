ASE for  Metadynamics Simulations
=================================

This tutorial shows how to use the :mod:`~ase.calculators.plumed` calculator
for computing Collective Variables from a Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectory. Besides, you 
will find an example of a Well-Tempered Metadynamics simulation using this calculator.

Plumed actually allows several actions like
implementing enhanced sampling methods (besides metadynamics), to
compute other different Collective variables that are not shown here, among other 
possibilities. For larger
description of plumed actions and details, visit `this page <http://www.plumed.org/doc>`_.
The use of other tools of Plumed with ASE is absolutely analogous to what it is 
explained here.

Theory
------

Collective Variables
====================

In the most of the cases, it is impossible to extract clear information about the system 
of interest
in monitoring the coordinates of all atoms directly, even more if our system contains 
a large 
quantity of atoms. Instead of that, it is possible to make the monitoring simpler by 
defining functions of those coordinates that describe the chemical properties that we are
interested in. Those functions are called Collective Variables (CVs) and allows biasing 
specific degrees of freedom or to analyze how those properties evolve.

An example of CV is the radius of gyration defined by:

.. math::
   \begin{align}
     R= \left(\frac{\sum_i^N |r_i - r_{CM}|^2}{N}\right)^{1/2}
   \end{align}

Where `r_{CM}` is the center of mass of the atoms, *N* is the number of atoms and
`r_i` is the position of atom i. From this definition, it is clear that the
radius of gyration contains information about how disperse is the system in respect
to the center of mass. That from just one scalar!

Plumed has numerous CVs already implemented that can be used with ASE. For
a complete explanation of CVs implemented in Plumed, go to

Metadynamics
============


:doi:`Metadynamics <10.1038/s42254-020-0153-0>` 
is an enhanced sampling method that allows exploring the configuration landscape 
by adding cumulative bias in terms of some CVs. This bias is added each 
`\tau` time lapse and usually its shape is Gaussian. In time t, that accumulated bias is
defined as:


.. math:: 
   \begin{align}
       V_{B}({\bf{s}}, t) = \sum_{t'=\tau, 2\tau,...}^{t'<t}W(t') \hspace{0.1cm}
                            exp\left({-\sum_i\frac{[s_i\hspace{0.1cm} - \hspace{0.1cm}
                            s_i(t')]^2}{2\sigma_i}}\right) \label{bias} \tag{1}
   \end{align}


Where **s** is a set of collective variables, `\sigma_i` is the width of the Gaussian 
related with the i-th collective variable, and *W(t')* is the height of the Gaussian in time *t'*.
In simple metadynamics, *W(t)* is a constant, but in Well-Tempered Metadynamics, the
height of the Gaussians is lower where previous bias was added. This reduction of height 
of the new Gaussians reduces the error and avoids exploration towards high free energy 
states that are thermodynamically irrelevant. Then, the height in time t' for 
Well-Tempered Metadynamics is defined as:

.. math:: 
   \begin{align}
       W(t') = W exp\left({-\frac{\beta \hspace{0.1cm} V_B({\bf s}, 
                  \hspace{0.1cm}t')}{\gamma}}\right) \label{hills} \tag{2}
   \end{align}

Here, *W* is the maximum height of the Gaussians, `\beta` is the inverse of
the thermal energy (:math:`1/k_BT`) and `\gamma` is a bias factor greater than zero that regulates
how fast the height of the bias decreases. The higher the bias factor, the slower is
the decreasing of the heights. Note that when `\gamma` approaches infinity, this equation 
becomes constant and simple metadynamics
is recovered. On contrast, when `\gamma` approaches 0, no bias is added, namely, the case
of Molecular Dynamics.

In this way, the force acting over the i-th atom becomes in:

.. math::
   \begin{align}
     {\bf F^B}_i = {\bf F}_i - \frac{\partial {\bf s}}{\partial {\bf R}_i} 
                   \frac{\partial V_B({\bf s}, t)}{\partial {\bf s}}\label{bias-force} \tag{3}
   \end{align}

where :math:`{\bf F}_i` is the force over the atom i due to interactions 
with the rest of atoms and the other term is the additional force due to the added bias.

Part of the power of metadynamics is that it can be used for exploring conformations and
the accumulated bias converges to the free energy surface. In the case of Well-Tempered
Metadynamics, it is:

.. math::
   \begin{align}
      \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} V_B ({\bf{s}}, t) = -\frac{(\gamma -1)}{\gamma} F({\bf s})
   \end{align}


Free Energy Reconstruction
--------------------------

Let's consider a simple system formed by seven atoms 
with Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions in a planar space. 
This simple model is presented in the 
`Plumed Masterclass 21.2 <https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.7/user-doc/html/masterclass-21-2.html#masterclass-21-2-ex-9>`_.
The LJ cluster has several stable isomers (shown below), 
which can be distinguished in a space of the CVs second and third central moments 
of the distribution of coordination numbers.

.. image:: cluster.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

The nth central moment `\mu_n` of an N-atoms cluster is defined as

.. math::
   \begin{equation}
      {\mu_n} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( {X}_{i} - \left< {X} \right> \right)^n
   \end{equation}

where `X_i` is the coordination number of the i-th atom:

.. math::
   \begin{equation}
      X_i= \sum_{i\ne j}\frac{1-(r_{ij}/d)^8}{1-(r_{ij}/d)^{16}}
   \end{equation}

For this example, d is fixed to `1.5\sigma`, in LJ units.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation
=============================

For showing that it is necessary to use an enhanced sampling method,
let's start with a Langevin simulation without bias. In LJ dimensionless reduced units, 
the parameters of the simulation are  `k_\text{B}T=0.1`, friction coefficient 
fixed equal to 1. 

It
is supposed that the system explores all the space of configurations due to thermal 
fluctuations. However, we can see 
that the system remains in the same state, even when we simulate an evolution 
of the system for a long time lapse. That is because a complete explotation
of the configuration space could take much more time than the possible to 
simulate. This can be shown
running the next code (this 
could take some minutes running):

.. literalinclude:: MD.py

This simulation is started with the configuration of minimum energy, whose coordinates
are imported from :download:`isomer.xyz`. Note that in the plumed set-up, it is added a 
line with the keyword UNITS. This is
necessary because all parameters in the plumed set-up are assumed to be in plumed
internal units. Then, this line is important to remain the units of the plumed parameters
in the same units as in ASE. You can ignore this line but be aware of the units changes.

Post Processing Analysis
========================

If you have the trajectory of a MD simulation and you want to compute a set of CVs
of that trajectory, you can reconstruct the plumed files without running again all 
the simulation. As an example, let's use
the trajectory created in the last code for rewriting the COLVAR file as follows:

.. literalinclude:: postpro.py


This code, as well as the previous one, generates a file called COLVAR with the value 
of the CVs.
All plumed files begin with a head that describes the fields that
it contains. In this case, it generates this result::

   $ head -n 2 COLVAR
   #! FIELDS time c1.moment-2 c1.moment-3
    0.000000 0.757954 1.335796

As you can see, the first column correspond to the time, the second one is the 
second central moment (SCM) and the thrid column is the third central moment (TCM). When we
plot this trajectory in the space of this CVs (that is, the second and third columns)
we obtain this result:

.. image:: MD.png
   :width: 400
   :align: center

Where we marked the points that corresponds with the different isomers.
Note that the system remains confined in the same stable state. That means,
for this case, MD is not enough for exploring all possible
configurations and obtaining a statistical study of the possible configurations 
of the system in the simulation time scale. Then, an alternative
is to use an enhanced sampling method. In this case, we implement Well-Tempered Metadynamics
for reconstructing the Free Energy Surface (FES).


Well-Tempered Metadynamics Simulation
=====================================


This method is described in the theory part. It basically adds external energy for
pushing the system to explore different conformations. This extra energy can generate that 
the atoms dissolve in vacuum. For that reason, it is necessary to add a restrain to avoid it.
This restriction consists in add a semi-armonic potential with this form:

.. math::
   \begin{equation}
       V(d_i)=\left\{
          \begin{array}{ll}
              100 (d_i - 2)^2 & \text{if }d_i>2 \\
              0               & \text{otherwise}
          \end{array}
          \right.
   \end{equation}

Where `d_i` is the distance of each atom to the center of mass. Note that this potencial does
not do anything whereas the distance between the atom and the center of mass os lower than 
2 `\sigma`, but if it is greater (trying to scape), this potential begins to work and 
send it back to be close the other atoms.

Then, the code for running this Well-Tepered Metadynamics in ASE is this one:

.. literalinclude:: MTD.py

Note that Well-Tempered Metadynamics requires the value of the temperature 
according to equation :math:`\ref{hills}`. Then,
it is necessary to define the kT argument of the calculator in the desired units. SIGMA and 
PACE are the initial  standard deviation and the deposition interval in terms of number of steps (`\tau`
of the equation :math:`\ref{bias}`). HEIGH and BIASFACTOR are the maximum height of the
Gaussians (W) and the `\gamma` factor of the equation :math:`\ref{hills}`, respectively. 

In this case, the Lennard-Jones calculator computes the forces between atoms, namely, 
:math:`{\bf F}_i` forces in equation :math:`\ref{bias-force}`. Likewise, 
you could use your preferred calculator. Plumed adds the bias forces.

When one runs a metadynamics simulation, Plumed generates a file called HILLS that contains the information of the deposited Gaussians.
You can reconstruct the free energy by yourself or can use the plumed tool 
`sum_hills <https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.7/user-doc/html/sum_hills.html>`_. 
The simplest way of using it is::

    $ plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS

After this, Plumed creates a fes.dat file with the FES reconstructed. When the FES of this 
example is plotted, it yields:

.. image:: fes.png
   :width: 400
   :align: center

Restart
=======

Suppose you realized it was not enough added bias when it finalized. Then, you have
to restart your simulation during some steps more. For doing so, you have to configure the atoms
object in the last state of previous simulation and to fix the value of steps in the plumed
calculator. Taking the last code as an example, this means you would have to change the 
definition of the object atoms as follows::

    from ase.io import read
    atoms = read('MTD.traj')

This allows to 
and the definition of the calculator becomes in::
    
    atoms.calc = Plumed( ... , restart=True)
    atoms.calc.istep = 500000

Alternativey, you can use the next function:

.. autoclass:: ase.calculators.plumed.restart_from_trajectory
